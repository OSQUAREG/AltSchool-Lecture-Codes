*Definitions:
Test Driven Development: - a software dev approach where test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. 

Test Cases for each functionality are created and tested first, if the test falls codes are rewritten to pass the test.

Stubs: they provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside.

Mocks: are spies, becuase they let you spy/simulate the behaviour of a function that is called indirectly by some other codes.

Test Driven Dev Frameworks in Python includes: Pytests, Nose, Unittest, etc

*Interacting WIth the Database from the app
ODM - Object Data Model
ORM - Object Relational Model
OGM - Object Graph Mapper

An ODM/ORM represents the websites data as Python objects, which are then mapped to the underlying database

Some ORMs are tied to a specific DB, while others provide a database-agnostic backend.

In Flask, we use:
SQLAlchemy (an (ORM) for Relational DB
Pymongo (an ODM) for No-SQL DB
Neo Model (an OGM) for Ghapic DB
Dynamo DB Client for Dynamo DB.
